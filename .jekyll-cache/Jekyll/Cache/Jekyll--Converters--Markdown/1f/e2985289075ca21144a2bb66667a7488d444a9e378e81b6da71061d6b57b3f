<p>Driving the top of the range model Volvo XC60 Inscription Pro was an absolute pleasure. The driving position gave a sense of control on the road. A high driving position mixed with the ergonomic design Volvo engineers for all their seats gives you a sense of stability.</p>

<p>The car is large in size yet the power steering makes you forget you are in control of such a large vehicle. The fact that is also all-wheel drive means that you feel the car moves together as a whole unit and even kicks the front up a little bit.</p>

<p>All the components of the vehicle feel as though they have been individually handcrafted for each car from the steering wheel to the handles on the doors. On this specific model, the gear stick has a crystal-like design which carries a sense of luxury and adds to the premium feel.</p>

<p>Large and heavy vehicles can sometimes come with a much louder cockpit noise level, this is negated in here. While there is still some noise, Volvo has done a good job in insulating it to reduce wind noise.</p>

<p>The performance of the XC60 was impressive, its 2.0-litre and boasts an impressive 232 BHP from itâ€™s Swedish engineered engine. What was surprising was the fuel economy, it seemed to sip the fuel and took the fuel gauge some time to show any change. This is great to see on a medium-size SUV.</p>

<p>Driving this vehicle was done in adverse weather conditions so I got to see how it handled in extremely wet and windy conditions. As mentioned earlier, this is an all-wheel-drive so there were no issues with handling on potentially hazardous corners. Motorway driving was a breeze, keeping its position in the lane with ease despite strong winds.</p>

<p>Now, onto one of the core reasons someone may decide to drive an SUV, the size. The amount of space throughout the car was fantastic, from the passenger space to the boot capacity.</p>
