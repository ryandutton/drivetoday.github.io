    <p>The BMW 3 series that is being reviewed is a 2-litre unleaded saloon E90 model, for those who are unsure this is the model in production between 2004-2013, this one is a 2010 model. It was driven as a long term every day driver and was operated in a variety of different conditions and environments.</p>

<p>An interesting fact about driving the 3 series is that it offers a great deal in both practicality and enjoyment. It is a large car with 5 seats and can comfortably accommodate for all of them seats to be occupied. The boot is large and has a wide opening so that it is easy to access anything stored in it.</p>

<p>It should be stated that like all BMW vehicles, this is a rear wheel drive. If you have not driven a rear wheel vehicle before then you will certainly notice the different when driving a BMW 3 series, especially when it comes to cornering the vehicle at high speeds.</p>

<p>Where you may find yourself driving along at a steady speed you may not want to put your foot down on the gas pedal otherwise you might find the rear end twitching a bit.</p>

<p>On country roads the car could find its way around corners without any issues and still find the power to get back up to speed without too much hassle. Where the 3 series is really in its prime is motorway driving and youâ€™re A-roads.</p>

<p>The large build of the car made it steady and comfortable when travelling along at high speeds. It is also quite in the cockpit when driving along the motorway at 70 miles per hour and found itself staying comfortably within its lane.</p>

<p>Many of the E90 3 series came without a console screen, for many people that may be considered a negative factor when deciding if they wanted to own and drive a car. For me it was a blessing, it was less of a distraction and when night driving it became much more engaging not having a distractive bright screen lighting up the entire interior. I was able to focus more on the road ahead and became more immersed in the driving experience.</p>
