This was an interesting vehicle to drive, it was a very high ride compared to the likes of the A-Class and A3, however, it handled just the same while also taking no more space when parking the vehicle in tight spots.

The size of the vehicle was lacking when it came to the interior. It shouts SUV when it comes to the look and feels but unfortunately lacks when it comes to size and capacity.

It's unclear what the intended use of this vehicle is. It looks like a quality vehicle that is trying to enter the SUV world but just not quite living up to the other vehicles in its range such as the Q3. 

Who is this vehicle for, it is unclear, but my take on it would be those who like compact sporty looking (not quite) SUVs and aren't bothered about space and capacity.

Audi Q2 is a very stylish vehicle both on the inside and out. It has very slick lines going the length of the vehicle. What wasn't so nice was the basic A3 interior which always feels like it is lacking something. The gear stick does have a premium feel to it though.

That being said, it was still very stylish and extremely well built for something near to an entry-level model.

The drive was nice. It isn't the quickest car about although it can be nippy at low speeds. The handling was also nice and smooth when cornering.

Overall, it is a pleasant car. It looks nice and sporty, has a good ride height and establishes you on the road. However, it is a lot of money for something that isn't quite as spacious as it looks. For the price tag, this comes as I'm not sure this would be the first choice for me.
