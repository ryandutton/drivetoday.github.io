Bottom line is the Cooper is a bundle of fun, nippy and exciting to drive. Unfortunately, it is a pretty impractical car for everyday use.

A quick breakdown of the entire driving experience in this vehicle was 3 days, around 400 miles and £60 in fuel. Throughout the test drive, I took the car on multiple different roads to see how it performed. What I found during the test drive was that it felt most at home on country roads.

While on the country roads it felt like it wanted to just keep on giving, the steering is a little heavy which made it feel more precise and comfortable when tackling what the Formby roads had to give. 

Fact that it is so nippy made taking corners much more fun as you do not have to worry about getting back up to speed. The sound that came from the engine when the turbo is engaged became highly addictive and I frequently wound the window down in the cold autumn weather just to hear the whine from the engine each time I set off from the lights.

Where it didn’t feel so comfortable was on the motorway. Driving along at 70 miles per hour made the Mini feel a little uneasy and the sound from inside was quite loud. It is safe to say, if you are going to be doing plenty of long-distance motorway driving, then this might not be the car for you.

Practicality of the vehicle again is lacking in space and storage. While driving the Mini I tested out the practicality by doing some shopping and it was at this point that I realised that the large bag full of Christmas presents did not fit in the boot (if you can call it that). It did however handle the weekly shop comfortably. 

While on the point of practicality I want to point out that while this is a “5 seat” vehicle, you would be lucky to fit anyone in the back of the two-door hatch. They build this car for two people and no more.

Overall, I highly approve of the Mini Cooper S, it is extremely enjoyable and put and smile on my face and keep it there the entire time that I was behind the wheel. Although this may not be the most practical car particularly for carrying large loads, it is certainly a fun car and will make a fantastic Sunday driver.
