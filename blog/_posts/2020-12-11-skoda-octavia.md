Skoda Octavia estates most impressive feature has got to be the uncompromising space that it comes with. There is enough space in there to cater for adventurous be it camping, golfing, skiing, or even a trip down to the DIY store.

The space this car provides will be appealing to anyone who uses their car for more than just commuting and weekly shop. As mentioned above, the boot size alone can accommodate a variety of different scenarios such as an airport run with the family in the car. With the seats down the capacity becomes extremely accomodating and will fit a decent sized snowboard and a couple of mountain bikes. This car is definitely about space.

Now it is not the most beautiful car on the market, however, that being said the recent work Skoda has done with the grill and the lines down the side of the vehicle has modernised the design. It certainly does not feel dated and likely will not for many years. There is not much else to point out about the exterior other than it being a reasonable mid-range car. A possible improvement could be to the wheels, they are very standard for the standard edition. For an SE model, it is a reasonable looking car.

What jumps out the most about the interior is the centre console, it comes with a reasonably large touch screen with an impressively easy user interface. The gear stick is also quite impressive with a nice robust gear change. Where it starts to lack in quality is the seats, the fabric lacks a soft touch. That being said about the quality of the seats, they are large and accomodating which is comfortable on long-distance drives.

For a 1.5 litre the car can be quite nippy, this feels like it is down to the transmission, gear changes are very smooth and seamless. Driving along the motorway at 70mph feels comfortable with little cabin noise and has a sturdy feel, gripping to the road. Handling can be clunky at times, especially navigating in tight spaces. Finally moving onto the fuel economy, it is reasonable for such a large vehicle and averaged out about 40mpg in the real world.

Overall, the Skoda Octavia estate was a very reasonable car for the price range it is in. The cabin experience felt nice and contemporary. Fixtures such as the door handles and armrest could improve. Space is fantastic and a very good car for the money. If I required an entry-level car with a lot of space I would certainly consider this car.
