Let's start with a quick breakdown of the entire driving experience. The vehicle was driven over 3 days, around 400 miles and a total of £60 in fuel. Throughout the test drive, I took the car on a variety of different roads to see how it well it performed. 

What I found during the test drive was it felt most at home on country roads. While on country roads it just kept on giving, the power and torque outputted from the engine are quite engaging. The steering is heavy making it feel more precise and comfortable when tackling what the Formby roads had to give. 

The fact that it is so nippy made cornering much more fun as you do not have to worry about getting back up to speed when on bendy roads. The sound that came from the engine when the turbo is engaged became highly addictive and I frequently wound the window down in the cold autumn weather just to hear the whine from the engine every time I set off from the lights.

Where it didn’t feel so comfortable was driving along the motorway. When I reached 70 miles per hour, the Mini feel a little uneasy and unsteady. The sound from inside was quite loud and overpowered the stereo at a moderate volume. It is safe to say, if you are going to be doing plenty of long-distance motorway driving, then this might not be the car for you.

The practicality of the vehicle is questionable. It is lacking in space and storage right across the vehicle. While driving the Mini I decided to test the space available by attempting to do some shopping. At this point, I realised the large bag of Christmas presents did not fit in the boot (if you can call it that) and I had to drop the rear seats to fit everything in the car. It did, however, handle the weekly shop comfortably. 

While on the point of practicality I want to point out that while this is a “5 seat” vehicle, you would be lucky to fit anyone in the back of the two-door hatch. They build this car for two people and no more.

Bottom line is, the Cooper is a bundle of fun, nippy and exciting to drive. Unfortunately, it is a pretty impractical car for everyday use.

Overall, I highly approve of the Mini Cooper S, it is extremely enjoyable and put and smile on my face and keep it there the entire time that I was behind the wheel. Although this may not be the most practical car particularly for carrying large loads, it is certainly a fun car and will make a fantastic Sunday driver.
