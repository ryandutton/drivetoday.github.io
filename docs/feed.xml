        <title>Volvo XC60 Inscription Pro, the mid-level premium SUV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Price: £43,400&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body Style: SUV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fuel Type: Electric Diesel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine Size: 1969cc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BHP: 232 BHP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Top Speed: 112 MPH&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0-60 MPH: 7.1 Secs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving the top of the range model Volvo XC60 Inscription Pro was an absolute pleasure. The driving position gave a sense of control on the road. A high driving position mixed with the ergonomic design Volvo engineers for all their seats gives you a sense of stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car is large in size yet the power steering makes you forget you are in control of such a large vehicle. The fact that is also all-wheel drive means that you feel the car moves together as a whole unit and even kicks the front up a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the components of the vehicle feel as though they have been individually handcrafted for each car from the steering wheel to the handles on the doors. On this specific model, the gear stick has a crystal-like design which carries a sense of luxury and adds to the premium feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/volvoxc60/interior.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volvo XC60 Interior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large and heavy vehicles can sometimes come with a much louder cockpit noise level, this is negated in here. While there is still some noise, Volvo has done a good job in insulating it to reduce wind noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of the XC60 was impressive, its 2.0-litre and boasts an impressive 232 BHP from it’s Swedish engineered engine. What was surprising was the fuel economy, it seemed to sip the fuel and took the fuel gauge some time to show any change. This is great to see on a medium-size SUV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving this vehicle was done in adverse weather conditions so I got to see how it handled in extremely wet and windy conditions. As mentioned earlier, this is an all-wheel-drive so there were no issues with handling on potentially hazardous corners. Motorway driving was a breeze, keeping its position in the lane with ease despite strong winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto one of the core reasons someone may decide to drive an SUV, the size. The amount of space throughout the car was fantastic, from the passenger space to the boot capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mini Cooper S Sport Hatch is a dream sunday driver</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Price: £24,580&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body Style: Hatchback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fuel Type: Petrol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine Size: 1998cc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BHP: 189 BHP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Top Speed: 146 MPH&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0-60 MPH: 6.70 Secs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a quick breakdown of the entire driving experience. The vehicle was driven over 3 days, around 400 miles and a total of £60 in fuel. Throughout the test drive, I took the car on a variety of different roads to see how it well it performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found during the test drive was it felt most at home on country roads. While on country roads it just kept on giving, the power and torque outputted from the engine are quite engaging. The steering is heavy making it feel more precise and comfortable when tackling what the Formby roads had to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that it is so nippy made cornering much more fun as you do not have to worry about getting back up to speed when on bendy roads. The sound that came from the engine when the turbo is engaged became highly addictive and I frequently wound the window down in the cold autumn weather just to hear the whine from the engine every time I set off from the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it didn’t feel so comfortable was driving along the motorway. When I reached 70 miles per hour, the Mini feel a little uneasy and unsteady. The sound from inside was quite loud and overpowered the stereo at a moderate volume. It is safe to say, if you are going to be doing plenty of long-distance motorway driving, then this might not be the car for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practicality of the vehicle is questionable. It is lacking in space and storage right across the vehicle. While driving the Mini I decided to test the space available by attempting to do some shopping. At this point, I realised the large bag of Christmas presents did not fit in the boot (if you can call it that) and I had to drop the rear seats to fit everything in the car. It did, however, handle the weekly shop comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the point of practicality I want to point out that while this is a “5 seat” vehicle, you would be lucky to fit anyone in the back of the two-door hatch. They build this car for two people and no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is, the Cooper is a bundle of fun, nippy and exciting to drive. Unfortunately, it is a pretty impractical car for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I highly approve of the Mini Cooper S, it is extremely enjoyable and put and smile on my face and keep it there the entire time that I was behind the wheel. Although this may not be the most practical car particularly for carrying large loads, it is certainly a fun car and will make a fantastic Sunday driver.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BMW 3 Series is an all-round great car</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The BMW 3 series that is being reviewed is a 2-litre unleaded saloon E90 model, for those who are unsure this is the model in production between 2004-2013, this one is a 2010 model. It was driven as a long term every day driver and was operated in a variety of different conditions and environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting fact about driving the 3 series is that it offers a great deal in both practicality and enjoyment. It is a large car with 5 seats and can comfortably accommodate for all of them seats to be occupied. The boot is large and has a wide opening so that it is easy to access anything stored in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stated that like all BMW vehicles, this is a rear wheel drive. If you have not driven a rear wheel vehicle before then you will certainly notice the different when driving a BMW 3 series, especially when it comes to cornering the vehicle at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you may find yourself driving along at a steady speed you may not want to put your foot down on the gas pedal otherwise you might find the rear end twitching a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On country roads the car could find its way around corners without any issues and still find the power to get back up to speed without too much hassle. Where the 3 series is really in its prime is motorway driving and you’re A-roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large build of the car made it steady and comfortable when travelling along at high speeds. It is also quite in the cockpit when driving along the motorway at 70 miles per hour and found itself staying comfortably within its lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the E90 3 series came without a console screen, for many people that may be considered a negative factor when deciding if they wanted to own and drive a car. For me it was a blessing, it was less of a distraction and when night driving it became much more engaging not having a distractive bright screen lighting up the entire interior. I was able to focus more on the road ahead and became more immersed in the driving experience.&lt;/p&gt;
